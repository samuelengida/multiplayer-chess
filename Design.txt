- Each chess piece is drawn using blender
- Each board piece is a quad so each board piece has an identity
- Selection of objects using a click was a challenge. RGB we can use the Red component to resemble something of an ID.


- The game provides minimum restrictions such as:
	- Turn management
	- Clicking on a board without clicking a piece does nothing
	- Difference between opponent and ally object.
	- Board pieces know if a chess object is on them

- However, the game can be viewed as a physical chess game. No provisions to hints
or illegal moves in place.

Future Considerations:
	- Provision of Hints
	- Restriction of moves for each piece
	- An AI a user can play with.
